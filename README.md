<h1>Hello</h1>
<p> This project was made for GameSIG, a yearly game development comeptition where university students from different institudes form
teams and showcase their game in the competition. I worked in a team of 4 developers under one of the committee members (Darren Denenberg)
of GameSIG to create this completely redesigned landing page. This was tasked to be a 7 week project during our school term and thus, we
were unable to make it responsive in any way (besides the hamburger menu) due to the team dealing with school and other projects.
This is made during my first weeks working with web development so unstardardized methods very used such as floats, margins/padding 
for alignment (instead of flexbox/CSS Grid/Bootstrap).

Nonetheless, it was a great experience because we worked with a client and really went through all stages of development to design our final
product. We used card sorting, user research, color theory, scenarios, personas, and much more during our brainstorming and design phase.
New logo design and wireframes/mockups were made in Sketch and the website was made with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScirpt.
