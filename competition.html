                <p>Between 30 and 50 teams will submit a YouTube video promoting their game this year. Consider your
                  video as a "movie trailer" or "marketing pitch". Your video will be individually reviewed by a group
                   of industry and academic personnel. They will rank each submission based on their perceptions of
                   the potential game play experience and marketability of the product as shown in the video. They
                   will also evaluate the conformity of the design to the one-page PDF document.</p>

                <p>Only the ten highest-ranking submissions will be accepted for the final round of the competition.
                   Your video needs to be engaging. It needs to clearly explain the strengths of the design and why
                   it will appeal to your target audience.</p>

                <p>It is expected that teams will modify their games after submitting a video, but only one video
                  may be submitted. Judges will not see the videos. They will make their final judgments based on
                  the live demos given during the event.</p>

            <p>GameSIG was founded by William Fisher, President of Quicksilver Software, Inc. in the 1990s. Together with other like
              minded entrepreneurs who wanted to put together a venue where young, bright, creative students could present their video
               game development talents. He sought out the assistance of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),
               a professional association formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and
               the Institute of Radio Engineers.</p>

            <p>IEEE organization's scope of interest has expanded into so many related fields, that it is simply referred to by the
              letters I-E-E-E (pronounced Eye-triple-E). Today IEEE is the world's largest association of technical professionals
              with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries around the world. Its objectives are the educational and technical
              advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering and allied disciplines. </p>

            <p>GameSIG together with IEEE, now known as IEEE GameSIG, is one of (if not the) first home collegiate video game competitions and
              they are very enthusiastic supporters of diversity in game development. Further, it’s no secret that IEEE GameSIG competitors
              have an edge when applying for jobs. Completing a challenging independent project like a game – even if you don’t win and even
              if you’re not a finalist – shows that you have self-discipline and dedication to your profession. That’s exactly what today’s
              employers are looking for. In fact, a number of IEEE GameSIG competitors have gone on to land jobs with local game companies
              or with exciting companies like Blizzard.</p>
